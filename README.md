n this activity, you'll create a GitHub Actions workflow to demonstrate parallel job 
execution. You'll configure jobs like lint, test, publish, and a matrix strategy job (test1) 
that runs on multiple operating systems in parallel. This is useful for testing your code 
across different environments at the same time. You'll create the workflow in your 
repository, observe how jobs run concurrently, and view output logs to understand the 
job structure and execution order.
